** Sales and Customer Behavior Analysis ** 

This repository contains an extensive analysis of Magnus Corporation's sales performance from 2015 to 2017. The goal of this analysis is to gain a better understanding of product category performance, customer behavior, and regional sales trends. Through various statistical methods and data visualizations, this analysis provides actionable insights to optimize business strategies, improve customer targeting, and drive overall sales growth. The dataset used includes information on product categories, customer demographics, sales figures, and order details, which has been explored using multiple analytical techniques.

Key Features and Insights
This analysis reveals multiple key insights into sales performance and customer behavior. The primary areas of focus include sales performance by category and subcategory, customer demographics, regional trends, and purchasing patterns. Significant findings include the identification of top-performing product categories, the influence of customer demographics such as gender, occupation, and age group, and the impact of geography on sales. The visualizations and statistical summaries help uncover trends over time, identifying areas of opportunity and growth for Magnus Corporation.

Business Questions Answered
The analysis directly addresses several business questions, shedding light on the companyâ€™s sales performance across categories and subcategories. For example, it was found that the Furniture category consistently generated the highest sales, contributing approximately $0.58 million in 2017. In comparison, categories like Toys and School Supplies accounted for lower sales volumes, around $0.13 million each. Subcategory analysis revealed that Living Furniture and Action Figures were the top performers within their respective categories. Further, customer behavior patterns were explored based on gender, occupation, and age group. It was found that Females accounted for 57% of total sales, highlighting the significant purchasing power of female customers. In terms of occupation, Professionals contributed the largest share of sales, followed by Management and Clerical workers. Age group analysis showed that customers in the 36-45 and 46-55 age ranges were the highest contributors to sales.

Time-Based Sales Trends
The analysis also examined sales trends over time, specifically from 2015 to 2017. The dataset revealed notable patterns in sales volume across different product categories and subcategories, helping identify which products experienced growth and which ones saw a decline in sales. For example, in 2016, Toys had the highest order quantity, while Furniture led in 2017. These insights can guide future sales forecasts and inventory planning, ensuring that Magnus Corporation is prepared to meet demand in key areas. Additionally, these trends were compared by region, identifying which areas showed the most growth and where improvements could be made.

Data Used
The analysis relies on a rich dataset containing detailed transactional data from Magnus Corporation. This includes product details (category, subcategory, cost, price), sales data (quantity sold, order details), and customer demographics (gender, age, occupation, education level). External demographic information was also used to provide a broader understanding of customer behavior and its correlation with sales trends. The data was cleaned and preprocessed for analysis, ensuring that the insights derived are both accurate and reliable.

Statistical Analysis Insights

Statistical analysis, including the correlation matrix and linear regression, offered insights into relationships between variables, such as strong correlations between product cost and price. While informative, statistical analysis was not the core focus of the report, which prioritized visualization and business insights.


Tools and Libraries
The analysis was performed using popular Python libraries, including Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization. Scipy was used for statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing and calculating p-values. Jupyter Notebook provided an interactive environment to run and document the entire analysis. These tools collectively enabled an in-depth exploration of the data, providing both high-level insights and granular details about customer behavior and product performance.
